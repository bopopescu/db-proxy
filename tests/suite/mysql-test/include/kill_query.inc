# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Kill a query in the oligarch connection, and then try to reap the
# result of the killed query.
#
# ==== Usage ====
# 
# The following variables should be set before sourcing this file.
#
# $debug_lock: name of the debug user lock, if set, will release/lock
#              the specified debug lock accordingly, and before
#              sourcing this, connection 'oligarch' should get the user
#              lock and run a query in another thread, which will
#              block before creating statement event.
#
# $connection_name: name of the connection that is waiting for the
#                   lock, this can not be 'oligarch'
#
# $connection_id: id of the connection that is waiting for the lock
#
# Example:
# let $debug_lock=;
# let $connection_name= oligarch1;
# let $connection_id= `SELECT CONNECTION_ID()`;
# send CREATE TABLE t1;
# source kill_query.inc;
#
# let $debug_lock= "debug_lock.before_query_log_event";
# eval SELECT GET_LOCK($debug_lock, 10);
# let $connection_name= oligarch1;
# let $connection_id= `SELECT CONNECTION_ID()`;
# send CREATE TABLE t1;
# source kill_query.inc;

# kill the query that is waiting
eval kill query $connection_id;

if ($debug_lock)
{
  # release the lock to allow binlog continue
  eval SELECT RELEASE_LOCK($debug_lock);
}

# reap the result of the waiting query

if ($debug_lock)
{
