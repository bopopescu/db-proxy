# Bug #958 a big table without indices and select with group by doesnt work
# this is a test for error 1032 in count(distinct) + group by, introduced in 
# mysql-4.1

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t1, t2;

CREATE TABLE t1 (id INTEGER, grp TINYINT, id_rev INTEGER);

let $1 = 1000;

  dec $1;

# We increase the size of t1 here.

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t1;

# As t1 contains random numbers, results are different from test to test. 
# That's okay, because we test only that select doesn't yield an
# error. Note, that --disable_result_log doesn't suppress error output.
