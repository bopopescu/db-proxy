# "Nested Set": This table represents an employee list with a hierarchy tree.
# The tree is not modeled by "parent" links but rather by showing the "left"
# and "right" border of any person's "region". By convention, "l" < "r".
# As it is a tree, these "regions" of two persons A and B are either disjoint,
# or A's region is completely contained in B's (B.l < A.l < A.r < B.r:
# B is A's boss), or vice versa.
# Any other overlaps violate the model. See the references for more info.

create table t1  (
  id     INTEGER AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  emp    CHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  salary DECIMAL(6,2) NOT NULL,
  l INTEGER NOT NULL,
  r INTEGER NOT NULL);


# Initial employee list:
# Jerry ( Bert () Chuck ( Donna () Eddie () Fred () ) )

select * from t1;

# Three successive raises, each one is 100 units for managers, 10 percent for others.

# Now, increase salary to a multiple of 50 (checks for bug#6138)
